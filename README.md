This is the software that I created during my internship in the spring of 2024.

Client: Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC)

Problem: INC is a grade type that enables students to conclude the remaining classwork that was left unfinished during the following semester. 
         The failure of a student to submit incomplete work by the next due date may result in their dismissal from the class (unresolved INC). 
         The following reasons account for the extremely low resolving percentage of BMCC, and this software strives to rectify them:
            1. Neglecting the existence of INC
            2. Faculty accessibility issue for the upcoming semester
            3. Confusion regarding the incomplete project
            
Objective: To establish a website or software that facilitates the interaction between faculty and students, with a particular emphasis on incomplete work.
